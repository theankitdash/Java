## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the [official](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886) website.

## Java Basics
This section covers the fundamental concepts of Java programming. Topics include:

* Syntax and Structure: Understanding the basic syntax and structure of a Java program.
* Variables and Data Types: Different types of variables and data types in Java.
* Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, and other operators.
* Control Flow: If-else statements, switch cases, loops (for, while, do-while).
* Methods: Defining and invoking methods.
* Arrays: Single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
## Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
This section introduces basic data structures and algorithms in Java. Topics include:

* Arrays: Operations on arrays, searching, and sorting.
* Linked Lists: Singly linked list, doubly linked list.
* Stacks and Queues: Implementation and operations.
* Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees.
* Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort.
* Searching Algorithms: Linear search, binary search.
## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This section delves into the principles of object-oriented programming. Topics include:

* Classes and Objects: Defining classes and creating objects.
* Inheritance: Single and multiple inheritance, the super keyword.
* Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding.
* Encapsulation: Getters and setters, access modifiers.
* Abstraction: Abstract classes and interfaces.
## Mathematical Concepts
This section covers basic mathematical concepts and their implementation in Java. Topics include:

* Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Prime Numbers: Checking for prime numbers, generating prime numbers.
* Factorials: Calculating factorial of a number.
* Fibonacci Series: Generating Fibonacci series.
* Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): Finding the GCD of two numbers.
* Least Common Multiple (LCM): Finding the LCM of two numbers.
## Java Games
This section includes simple Java games to make learning fun. Projects include:

* Guess the Number: A game where the player guesses a randomly generated number.
